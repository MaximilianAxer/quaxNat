\title{Dispersal Kernels From Spatial t Distribution}
\usage{
Clark2dt(x, par)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of distances to the nearest seed source.}

\item{par}{Numeric vector with three elements representing the
log-transformed parameters \eqn{a} and \eqn{p} and the scaling \eqn{N}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of function values multiplied by \eqn{N}.
}
\description{
\code{Clark2dt} computes the value of the dispersal function from Clark et al.
(1999) multiplied by \eqn{N}.
}
\details{
The dispersal kernel, i.e. spatial probability density
of the location of a seed relative to its source, is here given by
\deqn{k(x)={\Gamma (d/2) \over \pi ^{d/2}a^{d}\Beta (p,d/2)}
  (1+{\left\|{x}\right\| \over a})^{-(p+d/2)},}
which corresponds to a probability density of the distance given by
\deqn{p(r)={2 \over a^{d}\Beta (p,d/2)}r^{d-1}(1+{r \over a})^{-(p+d/2)},}
where \eqn{d} is the spatial dimension and \eqn{\left\|{\,}\right\|}
denotes the Euclidean norm; see Clark et al. (1999) and Austerlitz et al.
(2004) for the planar case (with parameterizations \eqn{a=\sqrt{u}} and
\eqn{p=b-1}, respectively). This represents a mixture of Gaussian
densities that exhibits heavier tails. It has its maximum at zero.

The spatial dispersal density, representing the probability
density function, divided by \eqn{2\pi x}, of the distance of a seed from
its source, is here given by
\deqn{f(x) = \frac{p}{\pi a^2 (1+(x/a)^2)^{p+1}},}
see Clark et al. (1999) and Austerlitz et al. (2004) (with
parameterizations \eqn{a=\sqrt{u}} and \eqn{p=b-1}, respectively). This
represents a mixture of Gaussian densities that exhibits heavier tails. It
has its maximum at zero.
