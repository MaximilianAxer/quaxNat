\usage{
optN(x, y, tau, fun, par, w, Nmax = 1e+06)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{represents the distance to the nearest seed source. Must be numeric}

\item{y}{response: regeneration density in corresponding unit (per ha)}

\item{tau}{determines the quantile}

\item{fun}{dispersal function, which is used}

\item{par}{are parameters to be estimated}
}
\description{
For given a,Ïƒ the global minimum in N can always be found with any desired precision, usually in a small number of steps, by successively shrinking an interval. We realize this as an inner, nested minimization in the function optN.
